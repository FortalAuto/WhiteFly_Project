Asset use optimization and tokenization


Development of a platform where companies, when joining the program, can make their assets available in stock. Assets are priced and if any company requests the material, it will bear the cost of the material and logistical expenses. The assigning company will receive a credit that can be used to request another asset that it needs. Logistics can be facilitated by adding companies such as Uber, Rappi, Correios, etc.

Allow companies to share "stranded" or obsolete assets. Reduced failure time, reduced lost productivity in participating companies. Use of new technologies to facilitate logistics. Blockchain for validating transactions between companies and cryptoactive option for acquiring credits for using the platform.
